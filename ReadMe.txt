I have made this website using Django framework and tried to make graph by Bokeh lib in python . Actually I am new to deploy bokeh graph because its not easy bokeh run in its own server .

 
How to run the App : To run the App you need to download zip file. then open command prompt and change the directory to the "Graph" folder inside zip using cd commands.Then run the "python manage.py runserver". This Should create a server at localhost and can open the website in the web browser.
